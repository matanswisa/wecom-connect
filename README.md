# Wecomconnect

Wecomconnect is a shift-management SaaS prototype for teams that work three daily shifts:

- Morning: 07:00-15:00
- Evening: 15:00-23:00
- Night: 23:00-07:00

The app focuses on a comfortable weekly scheduling workflow, employee availability, conflict warnings, exports, and manager-approved shift swaps.

## Stack

- Next.js + React + TypeScript
- Node route handlers
- PostgreSQL
- Vitest
- Playwright

## Local Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

## Docker Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

The `app` service waits for PostgreSQL, runs the schema migration, and starts Next.js on `http://localhost:3000`. Run `npm run db:seed` separately when you want local demo data.

The seed creates local manager and employee fixtures using `DEMO_PASSWORD`
(or a local-only default). The script refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Netlify Deployment

1. Connect this GitHub repository to a new Netlify project.
2. In the project, open **Database** and initialize Netlify Database, or run `netlify database init --yes` from a linked checkout.
3. Add a strong `AUTH_SECRET` under **Project configuration → Environment variables**.
4. Deploy the branch. Netlify detects `@netlify/database`, provisions PostgreSQL, and applies the SQL files under `netlify/database/migrations/` before publishing.
5. Create the first manager once with `npm run db:create-admin`, using the production database connection temporarily as `DATABASE_URL` and setting `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_NAME`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` locally.

Public registration is disabled. Managers create employee accounts from the dashboard;
the first manager is bootstrapped once with the production-safe admin script.

## Scheduling Rules

- The visible schedule is Sunday through Saturday, with a current date for every day.
- The availability panel always targets the Sunday-through-Saturday week two weeks ahead, independently of the schedule week being viewed.
- Employees can receive up to 6 shifts per week.
- Unmarked availability is treated as available. Employees can mark a shift as preferred or unavailable and can set a full-day vacation (`חופש`) status.
- Availability conflicts and rest gaps of 8 hours or less require a manager warning confirmation but do not prevent an intentional assignment.
- Weekly summaries show shift count and work hours per employee.
- Every shift can contain only one employee. Replacing an occupied shift requires an explicit manager confirmation.
- Assigned names are bold and colored by shift: morning green, evening yellow, and night red.
- Managers can export a UTF-8 CSV table containing employee, day, date, shift, time, and weekly totals.
- Swap requests can be reviewed by the target employee and manager in either order. A rejection closes the request immediately; after both approve, the assignment is applied automatically.
- Only one active swap request is allowed per source assignment; older duplicate requests are closed automatically when the database is migrated.
- If `MANAGER_APPROVAL_EMAIL` is configured, submitting a swap request emails that address with one-click approve/decline links, so a manager can respond without opening the app. The link only shows a confirmation page on click; the decision itself is applied when that confirmation is submitted, so link-prefetching by email scanners can't silently approve or decline a swap. This is an additional channel — the in-app manager approval buttons work exactly as before, and the swap is still only applied once both the target employee and a manager (via either channel) have approved.
- Managers can auto-generate a week's schedule with one click. The generator only fills currently empty shifts (existing assignments are left untouched) and, for each empty shift, prefers an employee who marked it as preferred, honors `UNAVAILABLE`/`חופש` blocks, and never exceeds an employee's weekly shift cap. It never schedules the same employee for two shifts in a row, and requires at least two other shifts (16h) of rest between any two of an employee's shifts; only when no employee can otherwise cover a shift does it relax that rest rule as a last resort. Any shift nobody can cover is left unfilled and reported for manual assignment.

## Personal Dashboard and Shared Files

- After login, employees land on a personal dashboard (`/`) showing their name, shift count and hours worked this week and this month, and their next upcoming shift. Managers without a linked employee record see a simplified version pointing them to the schedule. The full schedule grid moved to `/schedule`; navigate between the dashboard, schedule, and files from the icon rail.
- `/files` is a shared library where any signed-in user can upload a PDF, Word (`.docx`), Excel (`.xlsx`/`.xlsm`), CSV, or text file (5MB limit) for everyone to view and download. A file can be deleted by whoever uploaded it or by any manager.
- The Files page is gated behind a shared access code (`FILES_ACCESS_CODE`): every user must enter it once before they can view, ask about, or download anything there. Entering it correctly unlocks the page for 30 days per browser. If the code isn't configured, the page stays locked for everyone rather than opening by default.
- If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured, each file gets an "ask a question" thread where anyone can ask about its content and get an AI-generated answer based only on the extracted text; the question and answer are saved so others can see the thread. Without that key, uploads/downloads still work, but asking a question returns a clear "not configured" message instead of an answer.

## Security

- The session cookie is encrypted and authenticated, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Secure` in production. Sessions expire after eight hours.
- Every API request reloads the current user and role from PostgreSQL before applying manager or employee permissions.
- Public registration is disabled; only a manager can create employee accounts.
- Login failures are rate-limited and security response headers are enabled.
- Browser local storage contains only the light/dark theme preference. Authentication data and employee data are not stored there.

## Verification

```bash
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

The end-to-end tests expect the Docker stack on `http://localhost:3000` and use the locally installed Google Chrome binary.
